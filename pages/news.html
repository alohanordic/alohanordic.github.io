  	  "Aloha Nordic is a San Francisco based team.  With little access to snow, they train by biking and roller-skiing.  In 2019, fourteen team members skied the Birkie (and the Birkie Giant Ski!).  They'll be back in 2020!"

	  <div class="subtitle">
		An Outside Magazine profile of Aloha Nordic's Garrett Heath, in which he discusses how his cross country skiing helped him win the Great Edinburgh XCountry
	  </div>
	  <div class="quote">
		“I think [cross-country skiing] helped with aerobic development, because with cross-country skiing, you can go for so much longer. We’d do long training sessions back then of, bare minimum, an hour-and-a-half, but you could ski up to five hours, which is just something you can’t do running... Overall, especially in a place like Edinburgh, I’ve raced so many times in the cold and snow cross-country skiing that it does help with your mindset.”
