  Watch Out for Garrett Health - An Outside Magazine profile of Aloha Nordic's Garrett Heath, in which he discusses how his cross country skiing helped him win the Great Edinburgh XCountry.
  “Outside Magazine: You were a five-time high school Nordic skiing state champion. How do you think that affected you as a runner? Do you still ski?

Garrett: I’ve gotten out a few times this fall. I went to Methow Valley in the eastern side of Washington for a weekend early in the season, and then I was up in Bend with the family over Thanksgiving, and then got out one more time over Christmas break back home. But I don’t do a ton of it anymore.
I think it helped with aerobic development, because with cross-country skiing, you can go for so much longer. We’d do long training sessions back then of, bare minimum, an hour-and-a-half, but you could ski up to five hours, which is just something you can’t do running. But one of the downsides is that it builds up a ton of upper body strength. That’s maybe useful for cross-country, but on the track, you look at all the best guys in the world, and everybody’s pretty lean. I’m hauling around a couple extra slabs of meat on my shoulders and back. Overall, especially in a place like Edinburgh, I’ve raced so many times in the cold and snow cross-country skiing that it does help with your mindset.”
